    <p>Before apartheid segregated South Africa’s people by color, Black South Africans were divided into tribes. 
        These tribes had a long history of conflict, particularly between the two dominant groups, the Zulu and the Xhosa. 
        The Zulu, a warrior people, fought back against European invaders and were decimated. The Xhosa people, by contrast, 
        tried to learn from the Europeans and resisted their invasion with strategy instead of violence. Resentment between 
        the two tribes grew during apartheid, and it escalated into war once apartheid was ended. Nelson Mandela was Xhosa, 
        like Trevor Noah’s mother. 
        Trevor Noah, the comedian and the author of Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood was born into apartheid in South Africa in 1984. 
        In telling stories of growing up during the years shortly before and after the end of apartheid, he weaves in insights about his home country’s history, 
        culture, and traditions. Even though Christianity had been forced on native South Africans by the Europeans, Trevor’s mother was a devout Christian who 
        took her family to multiple churches every Sunday. Each church offered something different and catered to a different racial demographic—mostly white,
         mostly Black, or mixed. Trevor truly enjoyed attending church, but not the logistics of commuting to these churches. The family would have to take a 
         complex succession of minibuses on the mornings when their secondhand car wasn’t working. Trevor’s mother was never easily intimidated and her faith 
         in God was unwavering. One morning when Trevor was nine years old, a bus driver began speaking menacingly to her mother, criticizing her for traveling
          without a man.
         She threw Trevor out of the bus at an intersection and then jumped out herself. Trevor, bleeding and confused, didn’t realize at the time that his mother 
         had likely just saved his life because bus drivers typically had ties to race gangs. His mother thanked God for saving them both, but Trevor asked if the next 
         time their car broke down, God could meet them at home instead
